    "# Network Recovery Using Netplan (Ubuntu Server)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "During the initial setup of a headless Ubuntu Server, the system booted correctly but **had no network connectivity**.  \n",
    "This prevented package installation, remote access (SSH), and normal server operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue occurred after:\n",
    "- Installing Ubuntu Server without active internet\n",
    "- Connecting the server through a managed switch\n",
    "- No DHCP lease being assigned automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Symptoms\n",
    "\n",
    "- `apt update` failed with: \n",
    "\n",
    "Temporary failure resolving 'archive.ubuntu.com'\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dhclient` was not available\n",
    "- `nmcli` was not installed\n",
    "- Network interface appeared as `UP` but without IPv4 address\n",
    "- `/etc/netplan/` directory existed but was **empty**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verified physical connectivity:\n",
    " ```bash\n",
    " ip a\n",
    "```\n",
    " Interface enp5s0 was detected but had no IPv4 address.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Confirmed link state:\n",
    " ```bash\n",
    "sudo ip link set enp5s0 up\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Verified Layer 2 / Layer 3 behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ No DHCP lease\n",
    "\n",
    "+ No default gateway\n",
    "\n",
    "+ DNS resolution failing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Confirmed that NetworkManager was not installed\n",
    "\n",
    "+ System was using Netplan + systemd-networkd"

    "1. Create Netplan configuration manually\n",

    "\n",
    "+ Netplan may ship without a default configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A server can be fully operational at L2 but unusable at L3/L7\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Always validate networking by layers\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Understanding Netplan + systemd-networkd is critical for headless servers\n",
    "\n",
    "+ This recovery process is a core sysadmin skill, not a beginner task\n",
